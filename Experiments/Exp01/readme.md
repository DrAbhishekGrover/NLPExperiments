Write a Python code to perform classification on Moview Review dataset using Naive Bayes Classifier. The code is to be implemented in code cells in python notebook as per the following points:

(a) Download dataset using NLTK package and print a specific review and label in the dataset.
(b) Create two pre-processing functions: (a) Stemming and (b) Lemmatization. Print the output string obtained after applying functions to raw tex.
(c) Use bag of words model to convert text to vectors and implement classification using Naive Bayes Classifier.

Packages to be used: NLTK, sklearn
